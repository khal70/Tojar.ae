# Code Scan Report

## Overview
This repository contains a Next.js 14 commerce application with an authenticated admin console, Supabase integrations for data access, and Stripe/Resend powered checkout and notifications. The scan reviewed source under `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `scripts/`, and configuration files to highlight correctness issues and future improvements.

## Build & Tooling
- `npm run build` succeeds after clearing the Next.js cache, although Supabase fetches log transient `TypeError: fetch failed` errors when credentials are missing or connectivity is blocked. The build output otherwise completes successfully.【F:scripts/clean-next.mjs†L1-L13】【af5919†L1-L44】
- `npm run lint` prompts for the initial Next.js ESLint configuration because no `.eslintrc` is present. Adding a project-specific ESLint setup will allow the existing script to execute automatically.【F:package.json†L5-L13】
- Vitest and Playwright scripts are defined but there are no tests in `tests/` or elsewhere. Establishing baseline unit/e2e coverage will help guard complex admin workflows.【F:package.json†L10-L13】

## Authentication & Security
- The admin layout guards all `/admin/*` routes by checking for the `sb-access-token` cookie and validating it against Supabase before rendering. Consider refreshing expired sessions by exchanging the stored refresh token, otherwise admins will be redirected to the login screen once the access token expires.【F:app/admin/layout.tsx†L11-L63】
- The admin login API now wraps Supabase sign-in in a try/catch, returning user-friendly failures and preventing unhandled exceptions when Supabase is unreachable. Introducing simple rate limiting (e.g., via middleware or edge functions) would mitigate brute-force attempts.【F:app/api/admin/login/route.ts†L18-L68】
- The client login form now surfaces network failures gracefully and avoids leaving the button in a loading state when the request fails. Additional UX enhancements such as inline password visibility toggles or success toasts could be considered.【F:components/auth/LoginForm.tsx†L13-L107】

## API & Data Access
- Checkout session creation now guards against Stripe outages and rounds currency amounts to the expected integer cents value, avoiding API rejections. The handler still posts a static `orderId: "placeholder"` metadata field; wiring this to a real order identifier will improve reconciliation.【F:app/api/checkout/route.ts†L5-L61】
- Supabase admin data helpers centralize null checking and graceful fallbacks when tables are unavailable. Repeated console noise could be reduced by tracking previously logged failures and exposing metrics in the UI instead of writing to stderr during static generation.【F:lib/admin-data.ts†L53-L199】
- The Supabase server client prefers the service-role key when available. Confirm that this code remains server-only and rotate credentials regularly, as the service key has elevated privileges.【F:lib/supabase-server.ts†L5-L31】

## Stripe & Webhooks
- Stripe webhook handling validates the signature, persists minimal order details to Supabase, and conditionally sends notifications through Resend. Consider enriching order persistence with checkout session metadata and retrying failed email sends since `Promise.allSettled` currently ignores rejection details.【F:app/api/webhook/route.ts†L1-L89】
- Administrative Stripe settings fetches touch the Connect API (`accounts.listExternalAccounts`). Handle the case where the account lacks Connect permissions to avoid surfacing errors to operators.【F:lib/stripe-admin.ts†L1-L99】

## Frontend & UX
- The admin shell provides breadcrumbs, a collapsible sidebar, and consistent layout primitives. Ensure breadcrumb generation accounts for dynamic slugs (e.g., `/admin/orders/[id]`) if those pages are added later.【F:components/admin/AdminShell.tsx†L1-L45】
- Shared UI primitives (`Card`, `Button`, `Input`) simplify styling but do not yet cover textarea/select use cases present in several admin forms. Extending the component set will reduce ad-hoc styling drift.【F:components/ui/Button.tsx†L1-L38】【F:components/ui/Input.tsx†L1-L39】

## Testing & Monitoring Recommendations
- Automate Supabase connectivity checks in CI to catch credential regressions earlier, rather than discovering failures in production builds.
- Add integration tests around the admin authentication flow (login, logout, protected routes) and Stripe webhook handler to prevent regressions in critical paths.
- Instrument key API routes (`/api/checkout`, `/api/admin/login`, `/api/webhook`) with structured logging to aid observability when deploying to Vercel.

## Conclusion
The application is structurally sound with guarded admin routes and modular data access layers. Addressing the above improvements—particularly linting setup, session refresh handling, and broader automated testing—will increase reliability as Supabase and Stripe integrations expand.
